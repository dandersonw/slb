# SLB

SLB stands for *s*emantic *l*ine *b*reaks, 
a method of writing source files
in languages in which single line breaks
preserve semantic meaning.
Specificially the ideas is to ease editing and minimize diffs
by chunking the natural language semantics
without affecting the semantics of the markup language used.
